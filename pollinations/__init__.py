## Image Generation
```python

    model="flux",
    seed="random",
    file="pollinations-image.png",
    width=1024,
    height=1024,

# (or) 
# (optional) model.file="image.png"
image = model("A dog and cat.", save=True)
```

## Async Image Generation
```python
async def async_example():
    image = await model.Async("A horse and pig.")
    # image = await model.Async("A horse and pig.", save=True)

    image.save("a_image.png")

# Stream Request
for token in model("Explain AI at a low level.", stream=True):

## Async Text Generation
```python
async def async_example():
    image = await model.Async("A horse and pig.")
    # image = await model.Async("A horse and pig.", save=True)

    image.save("a_image.png")
    print(image)
    print(model)
```

## Audio Transcription
```python
model = pollinations.Text()

print(model.Transcribe("test.mp3"))
```
